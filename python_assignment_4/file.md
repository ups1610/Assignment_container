### Answer:

1. The purpose of the General Linear Model (GLM) is to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a flexible framework used for various statistical analyses, including regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

2. The key assumptions of the General Linear Model include:
   - Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables is linear.
   - Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
   - Homoscedasticity: The variability of the dependent variable is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
   - Normality: The dependent variable follows a normal distribution.

3. The coefficients in a GLM represent the change in the mean value of the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other variables constant. They indicate the direction and magnitude of the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable.

4. In a univariate GLM, there is only one dependent variable being analyzed in relation to one or more independent variables. It focuses on understanding the relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable separately.

   In a multivariate GLM, there are multiple dependent variables being analyzed simultaneously in relation to one or more independent variables. It allows for examining the relationships between the independent variables and multiple dependent variables, taking their interdependencies into account.

5. Interaction effects occur in a GLM when the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on the level or value of another independent variable. In other words, the relationship between the dependent variable and one independent variable is not constant across different levels of another independent variable. Interaction effects allow for exploring the combined effects of variables and can provide insights into complex relationships within the data.

6. Categorical predictors in a GLM are typically represented using dummy variables. Each category of the categorical predictor is encoded as a binary variable (0 or 1) indicating its presence or absence. These binary variables are then included as independent variables in the GLM. The coefficient associated with each dummy variable represents the difference in the mean response between that category and the reference category.

7. The design matrix in a GLM represents the mathematical formulation of the model. It is a matrix that combines the independent variables and their associated coefficients to predict the dependent variable. Each row of the design matrix corresponds to an observation, and each column represents a different independent variable or predictor. The design matrix is used to estimate the regression coefficients through methods like ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood estimation.

8. The significance of predictors in a GLM is tested using statistical hypothesis tests. The most common approach is to use a t-test or F-test to evaluate whether the estimated coefficient for each predictor is significantly different from zero. The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the predictor and the dependent variable. The p-value associated with each test is used to determine the significance of the predictor. If the p-value is below a predetermined significance level (e.g., 0.05), the predictor is considered statistically significant.

9. Type I, Type II, and Type III sums of squares are different methods for partitioning the variance in a GLM. The choice of which type to use depends on the specific research question and the design of the study.

   - Type I sums of squares sequentially tests each predictor's contribution to the model while controlling for the effects of previously entered predictors. It is appropriate when predictors have a specific order or hierarchy.
   - Type II sums of squares tests each predictor's contribution to the model while ignoring the effects of other predictors. It is appropriate when predictors are not hierarchical or when there is no specific order.
   - Type III sums of squares tests each predictor's contribution to the model while adjusting for the effects of all other predictors. It is appropriate when predictors are not hierarchical, and interactions are present.

10. Deviance in a GLM is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model. It quantifies the discrepancy between the observed data and the predicted values from the GLM. It is analogous to the residual sum of squares in linear regression. Deviance is minimized when the model fits the data well, and it is used for model comparison and hypothesis testing, such as likelihood ratio tests. Lower deviance indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
